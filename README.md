# Model Optimizations

TensorFlow 2.0 is tightly integrated with TensorFlow and offers high performance for deep learning inference through a simple API. This repository use examples to show you how to optimize an app using TensorRT or TF-Lite with the new Keras APIs in TensorFlow 2.0. They show you tips and tricks to get the highest performance possible on GPUs and detail examples of how to debug and profile apps using tools by NVIDIA and TensorFlow. You’ll walk away with an overview and resources to get started, and if you’re already familiar with TensorFlow, you’ll get tips on how to get the most out of your application.
